# Email Tone Transfer

Email Tone Transfer is an AI solution that can convert text/prompt into an email or translate a given email into plain/understandable language. The goal of this project is to provide an email generation or email summarization tool for English learners or neuroatypical users. 

## Features

Two chat bots hosted on [Poe](www.poe.com) that respectively generate an email or summarize an email:
- [Email Generation](https://poe.com/EmailAssistant0)
- [Email Summarization](https://poe.com/tonetranfer)

## Getting Started
Use the links above to access the Poe chatbots for your specific need. 

If interested, you can visit Poe's website to learn more about Poe bots, as well as how custom bots are created. 

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Our community is supportive, and we provide training and classes if you're new to any of the frameworks used in the project. Everyone is welcome to contribute, as we believe participating in data science and AI projects is an excellent way to learn.

## Planning & Goals 

To choose which method works best (two specialized bots or one general bot), we will create a spreadsheet of prompts, bot responses, and our rating of that response. Then, we choose the best option and make that publicly available!
