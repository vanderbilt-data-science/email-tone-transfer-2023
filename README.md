# Email Tone Transfer

Email Tone Transfer is an AI solution that can convert text/prompt into an email or translate a given email into plain/understandable language. The goal of this project is to provide an email generation or email summarization tool for English learners or neuroatypical users. 

## Features

Two chat bots hosted on [Poe](www.poe.com) that respectively generate an email or summarize an email:
- [Email Generation](https://poe.com/EmailAssistant0)
- [Email Summarization](https://poe.com/tonetranfer)

## Getting Started

Our community is supportive, and we provide training and classes if you're new to any of the frameworks used in the project. Everyone is welcome to contribute, as we believe participating in data science and AI projects is an excellent way to learn.

## Planning & Goals 

The following approach was taken when designing and generating our bots: 
- We first set up a vision meeting to discuss the method and approach we wanted to take in designing our bots. We settled on the idea of using Poe.com, a platform that allows us to generate bots using prompts. These bots are powered by third party companies that use large language models (LLMs).

- In our initial meeting, we decided to test out two approaches: creating a general bot that accomplished both the converting text/prompt into an email AND translating a given email into plain/understandable language vs. creating two specific bots that that tackled each of these goals separately.
- One general bot was set up, two text -> email bots were set up, and one email -> text bot was set up
- We created a spreadsheet for bot evaluation, where each bot occupied one page on the spreadsheet. The hidden prompt was displayed at the top of each page, and team members were asked to generate text or emails, depending on the bot, and test out the features of each bot. Team members were asked to include the bot responses in the spreadsheet, and to then evaluate the responses on a scale of 1-10.
- As a group, we decided which bot group (general or specific) performed the best based on the ratings we provided. After reviewing our comments and ratings, we decided the specific bots performed the best. 
- The email -> text bot was improved upon. The text -> email bots were condensed into one, and were modified to reduce the number of assumptions made by the bot. Both bots were powered by ChatGPT 3.5.
- We ended by testing out the perfected bots, and writing down our thoughts/concerns. 
- After addressing all of the remaining issues, we saved the links to our tested and approved bots, and closed out the project.
