# Email Tone Transfer

Email Tone Transfer is an AI solution that can convert text/prompt into an email or translate a given email into plain/understandable language

## Features

- One bot that can accomplish both tasks OR Two bots, one for converting text/prompt and one for translating.

## Getting Started

We will be using www.poe.com custom bot creation, so visit the website and familiarize yourself with how the bot creation works

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Our community is supportive, and we provide training and classes if you're new to any of the frameworks used in the project. Everyone is welcome to contribute, as we believe participating in data science and AI projects is an excellent way to learn.

## Planning & Goals 

To choose which method works best (two specialized bots or one general bot), we will create a spreadsheet of prompts, bot responses, and our rating of that response. Then, we choose the best option and make that publicly available!
